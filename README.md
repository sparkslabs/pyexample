PyPackagingExample
==================

This is an example python repository for the purpose of keeping track of how to do packaging nicely.
It doesn't even vaguely pretend to be right at as of now (Jan 2016).

It's been useful in the past though which is why it's here.

(My primary packaging targets as of Jan 2016 are for pypi and ubuntu 14.04LTS)
